# Patient Passport
This app was designed to reduce and eliminate the element of human error in paperwork at small clinics. Patients can input their information into our app, which will securely store that information in our database. When they go to a clinic that supports our app, the clinic can simply scan a QR code generated on the patient end, and the information will be imported into the clinic's database. This automation will reduce errors by secretaries in copying handwritten information into a computer, and will help further secure patient information.

## Functionalities
Our app has the following functionalities:
* Clinics can scan a QR code to sync patient data with their database
* Clinics can select which patient information is recieved
* Patients can register using a verified email
* On first logging in, patients will be required to enter some basic information
* More information will be available to fill in once the user is registered
* Information is easily available and editable via a search function
* Users can recover forgotten passwords
* Users can remove themselves from our system by deleting their account (all patient information is deleted as well)
